Synthetic Healthcare Dataset (2018–2024) — Data Description

Story / Context
This dataset represents anonymized inpatient episodes recorded across multiple regions. Each row corresponds to one patient episode in a given year (2018–2024). The variables capture basic demographics, administrative information (insurance and admission type), broad clinical service line, basic clinical measurements, utilization (length of stay), cost, discharge disposition, and whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days.
